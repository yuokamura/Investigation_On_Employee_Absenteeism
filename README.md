# Invetigation_On_Employee_Absenteeism
## General description
These files are from assignment I worked on as a part of course "The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp" by 365 Careers.
In this case study, I explored whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not. 
Absenteeism was defined as: absence from work during normal working hours, resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity.
